# hello-world

I am a seeker, inquirer, analyser and a questioner. I am curious about life, universe and everything!
Most importantly, I am curious about data (throw-in any data and I might spend hours analysing its patterns and beauty). This curiosity gladly earns me my livelihood too. 

"I have no special talent, I am only passionately curious." - Albert Einstein
